\puzztitle{Puzzle 7: Movies}

Dr.~Camp wants to go to the movies with the CS@Mines professors.~She told each
one of them what movie and when, but it seems none of them heard the same
thing.

If the professors work together and see how their schedules line up, they'll
find out who can go.

Can you help them find out what movie Dr.~Camp actually meant?
